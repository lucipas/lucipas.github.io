         Hi, my name is Lucas Nguyen.
         I am a software engineer based
         out of Atlanta, Georgia. I
         enjoy a multitude of things
         ranging from cyber and physical
         security to retro gaming.

::reset::
	 I am currently working on a macro based
	 HTML templating language using GNU utils
	 like sed and awk. It is what I used to
	 make this website.
	 ::hide::(if you were not in plaintext...)::show::
	 [github](https://github.com/lucipas/lucipas.github.io)
	 ::hide::it also does ANSI ESC codes. Wow!::show::
	 If you are reading this you might realize
	 that this is a plaintext mirror of the
	 HTML website.
         ::-----------::

	 This is to keep terminally obsessed people
	 like me in the terminal. Nearly all modern
	 terminals can style text using ANSI escape
	 codes making it a lightweight alternative
	 to a heavy browser.

	 That's nice, eh?

	 Here is some assumptions that I will make.

	 * You will read this through a terminal.
 	 ::hide::you're terminally obsessed too? Wow::show::
	 There are some styling things here that
	 would look nice if piped through a
	 terminal.

	 * Your terminal doesn't support sixels.

	 There will be two links if I feel that
	 an image is needed. One is the sixel
	 file that you can cURL and one that is
	 a traditional photo.

	 * You know how to use less or more.

	 I might yap for a really long time.
	 Sorry in advance.
