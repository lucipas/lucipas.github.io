         Hi, my name is Lucas Nguyen.
         I am a software engineer based
         out of Atlanta, Georgia. I
         enjoy a multitude of things
         ranging from cyber and physical
         security to retro gaming.

	 I am currently working on a macro based
	 HTML templating language using GNU utils
	 like sed and awk. It is what I used to
	 make this website.

	 [github](https://github.com/lucipas/lucipas.github.io)
	 [8mit also does ANSI ESC codes. Wow![28m
	 If you are reading this you might realize
	 that this is a plaintext mirror of the
	 HTML website.

	 This is to keep terminally obsessed people
	 like me in the terminal. Nearly all modern
	 terminals can style text using ANSI escape
	 codes making it a lightweight alternative
	 to a heavy browser.

	 That's nice, eh?

	 Here is some assumptions that I will make.

	 * You will read this through a terminal.
 	 [8myou're terminally obsessed too? Wow[28m
	 There are some styling things here that
	 would look nice if piped through a
	 terminal.

	 * Your terminal doesn't support sixels.

	 There will be two links if I feel that
	 an image is needed. One is the sixel
	 file that you can cURL and one that is
	 a traditional photo.

	 * You know how to use less or more.

	 I might yap for a really long time.
	 Sorry in advance.
